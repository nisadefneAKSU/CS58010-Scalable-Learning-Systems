Put:

fedala folder -> Under openfgl/flcore (The folder where FedALA logic is implemented)

baseline_fedala.py -> Under OpenFGL-main (main folder) (The trainer we implement, test and evaluate for experiments)

basic_utils.py -> Under openfgl/utils (Added FedALA client and server)

config.py -> Under openfgl/flcore (Added fedala for support purposes)

requirements.txt -> Under docs (For local setup to use in Windows - if you need it)

results.txt -> Under OpenFGL-main (main folder) or you can generate it also

Note: New data folder will be generated with your own trainer under OpenFGL-main after running baseline_fedala.py
