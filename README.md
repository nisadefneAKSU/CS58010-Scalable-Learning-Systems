# CS58010-Scalable-Learning-Systems

After downloading OpenFGL main repository please put:

fedala and gfedala folder -> Under openfgl/flcore (The folder where FedALA/GFedALA logic is implemented)

main.py -> Under OpenFGL-main (main folder) (The trainer we implement, test and evaluate for experiments)

basic_utils.py -> Under openfgl/utils (Added FedALA and GFedALA client and server)

config.py -> Under openfgl/flcore (Added "fedala" and "gfedala" for support purposes)

requirements.txt -> Under docs (For local setup to use in Windows - if you need it)

Note: New data folder will be generated with your own trainer under OpenFGL-main after running main.py
